# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
***ALX Software Engineering Programme Project***

## Introduction

This group project involves implementing a scripting language called Monty 0.98, which is compiled into Monty byte codes. Monty relies on a unique stack with specific instructions for manipulating it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCode files.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding of LIFO and FIFO principles
- Knowledge of what a stack is and when to use it
- Understanding of what a queue is and when to use it
- Familiarity with common implementations of stacks and queues
- Recognition of common use cases for stacks and queues
- Proper use of global variables

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89
- All code files should end with a new line
- A README.md file in the project folder is mandatory
- Code must follow the Betty style (to be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl)
- Maximum of one global variable is allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The C standard library can be used
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file named `monty.h`
- All header files should be include guarded

## Data Structures

For this project, please use the following data structures and include them in your `monty.h` header file:

```c
/**
 * struct stack_s - doubly linked list representation of a stack (or queue)
 * @n: integer
 * @prev: points to the previous element of the stack (or queue)
 * @next: points to the next element of the stack (or queue)
 *
 * Description: doubly linked list node structure
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO
 */
typedef struct stack_s
{
        int n;
        struct stack_s *prev;
        struct stack_s *next;
} stack_t;

/**
 * struct instruction_s - opcode and its function
 * @opcode: the opcode
 * @f: function to handle the opcode
 *
 * Description: opcode and its function
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO
 */
typedef struct instruction_s
{
        char *opcode;
        void (*f)(stack_t **stack, unsigned int line_number);
} instruction_t;

## Compilation & Output
The code will be compiled using the following command:

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty

> All output must be printed on stdout
> Any error message must be printed on stderr

## The Monty Program

Usage: monty file where file is the path to the Monty byte code file.
If no file or more than one argument is provided, print the error message "USAGE: monty file" and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
If the file cannot be opened, print the error message "Error: Can't open file <file>" and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
If an invalid instruction is found in the file, print the error message "L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>" and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
If malloc fails, print the error message "Error: malloc failed" and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
You are only allowed to use malloc and free and not other functions from the malloc family (realloc, calloc, etc.).

## Tasks

0. push, pall
Implement the push and pall opcodes.
> The push opcode pushes an element onto the stack.
> The pall opcode prints all values on the stack from top to bottom.

1.   
Implement the pint opcode.
> The pint opcode prints the value at the top of the stack.

2. pop
Implement the pop opcode.
> The pop opcode removes the top element of the stack.

3. swap
Implement the swap opcode.
> The swap opcode swaps the top two elements of the stack.

4. add
Implement the add opcode.
> The add opcode adds the top two elements of the stack.

5. nop
Implement the nop opcode.
> The nop opcode does nothing.
 
6. sub
Implement the sub opcode.
>The opcode sub subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack.

7. div
Implement the div opcode.
>The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

8. mul
Implement the mul opcode.
>The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.

9. mod
Implement the mod opcode.
>The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

10. comments
Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (donâ€™t do anything).

11. pchar
Implement the pchar opcode.
>The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

12. pstr
Implement the pstr opcode.
>The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

13. rotl
Implement the rotl opcode.
>The opcode rotl rotates the stack to the top.

14. rotr
Implement the rotr opcode.
The opcode rotr rotates the stack to the bottom.

15. stack, queue
Implement the stack and queue opcodes.
>The opcode stack sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO). This is the default behavior of the program.

16. Brainf*ck
Write a Brainf*ck script that prints School, followed by a new line.
All your Brainf*ck files should be stored inside the bf subdirectory.
You can install the bf interpreter to test your code: sudo apt-get install bf.

17. Add two digits
Add two digits given by the user.
Read the two digits from stdin, add them, and print the result.
The total of the two digits will be one

18. Multiplication
Multiply two digits given by the user.

Read the two digits from stdin, multiply them, and print the result
The result of the multiplication will be one digit-long (<10)

19. Multiplication level up
Multiply two digits given by the user.

Read the two digits from stdin, multiply them, and print the result, followed by a new line

## Compilation & Output
The code will be compiled this way:

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty

>Any output must be printed on stdout
>Any error message must be printed on stderr
